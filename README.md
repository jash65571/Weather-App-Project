Weather App Project
Project Overview:
The Weather App is a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city, state, or country. This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in a clean and visually appealing interface. The app features dynamic weather icons, temperature readings, humidity levels, and wind speed.

Key Features:

Real-time Weather Data: Fetches and displays the latest weather information based on user input, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Dynamic Weather Icons: Shows appropriate weather icons based on the current weather conditions (e.g., rain, clear, clouds, mist, drizzle, haze, snow).
Interactive Search: Allows users to enter any city, state, or country to get the latest weather information for that location.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application looks great and works well on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Technologies Used:

HTML5: Provides the structure and content for the application.
CSS3: Styles the application with a modern and clean design, including responsive layout techniques.
JavaScript (ES6): Adds interactivity and handles the logic for fetching and displaying weather data.
OpenWeatherMap API: Provides the weather data used in the application.
How It Works:

User Interaction: Users can enter the name of a city, state, or country in the search bar and click the search button.
Data Fetching: The application makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap using the provided location and retrieves the current weather data.
Data Display: The application updates the UI with the fetched weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon based on the weather conditions.
